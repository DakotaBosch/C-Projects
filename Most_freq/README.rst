Most Frequent Char
==================

Complete most_freq.cpp such that the program counts the occurrence of each charcater in a given string and returns
the count of the most frequently occurring character. The program receives the string from stdin from the user.
If the input string is "george orwell", the most frequently occuring character is "e".
So, the program should output 3.
